# HybridUNet-Efficient-3D-Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-with-EfficientNet-and-ConvLSTM
HybridUNet is a deep learning model designed for accurate and efficient 3D medical image segmentation using the BraTS2020 dataset. It combines EfficientNet for robust 2D spatial feature extraction and ConvLSTM for capturing temporal (volumetric) dependencies, making it well-suited for brain tumor segmentation.
